# Usage

## 1. Install TailwindCSS
If you want the build script to build TailwindCSS files too, you should use the standalone version. See https://tailwindcss.com/blog/standalone-cli

Change the `TAILWIND_EXECUTABLE` setting in `scripts/settings.py` to point to the executable's path.

## 2. Install the requirements
`$ pip install -r requirements.txt`

## 3. Build the blog
`$ python3 scripts/blog.py`
